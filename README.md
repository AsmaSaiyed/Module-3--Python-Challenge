**Module 3 Python Challenge:**

This Challenge comprises of using Python code for two seperate files in VS Code. The main folder incudes 2 seperate folders Py Bank and Py Poll. Each folder includes the main code file and the text file with the output.In each folder there are 3 different things; A new file called main.py which will be the main script to run for each analysis.A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used and An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.


**PY Bank**

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the Financial Records. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The aim of this challenge is to calculate each of the following values:

1.The total number of months included in the dataset

2.The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3.The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4.The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5.The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Then analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

**PY Poll**

In this challenge the task is related with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The goal here is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast

1.A complete list of candidates who received votes

2.The percentage of votes each candidate won

3.The total number of votes each candidate won

4.The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Total Votes: 369711
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
Winner: Diana DeGette
