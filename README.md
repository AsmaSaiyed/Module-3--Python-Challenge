**Module 3 Python Challenge:**

This Challenge comprises of using Python code for two seperate files in VS Code. The main folder incudes 2 seperate folders Py Bank and Py Poll. Each folder includes the main code file and the text file with the output.

##PY Bank
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the Financial Records. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The aim of this challenge is to calculate each of the following values:

1.The total number of months included in the dataset

2.The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3.The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4.The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5.The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

6.Then analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.
